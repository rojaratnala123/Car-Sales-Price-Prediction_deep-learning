Methodology

Data Collection: Gather the dataset and preprocess it to address missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Transform and create features to enhance model performance, such as converting categorical variables into numerical formats using one-hot encoding.
Model Development:
Build a Deep Learning ANN with layers designed to capture complex relationships in the data.
Utilize activation functions (e.g., ReLU) and techniques like dropout for regularization.
Model Training: Train the model on a training dataset and validate using a separate validation set, tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values.
